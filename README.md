A demonstration of getting suggestions for code review using GPT modules.
Modules can be both via importing or locally saved.

#### Note: Suggestions always depends on how the question is framed in the prompt string.

#### Some examples

#### Questions: Could you give some recommendations for improving the code execution time?

Suggestion:  Sure, here are some suggestions to improve the code execution time:
1. Use generator expression instead of a loop in the `generate_numbers_for_given_limit` function. This can reduce the number of operations and improve performance.
2. Consider using a lazy evaluation technique such as `defer` or `lazy` to avoid generating all elements upfront. This can also reduce the number of operations and improve performance.
3. Use tail recursion instead of a loop in the `print_limit_values` function. Tail recursion is less prone to stack overflow errors and can be more efficient than using a loop.

#### Questions: Could you give some recommendations for improving the code? and sorting suggestions list by priority from high to low.

Suggestion:  Sure, here are some recommendations for improving the code:
1. Use meaningful variable names instead of "count". For example, use "numbers_generated" or "limit_values_produced".
2. Consider using a loop that generates multiple values and only prints them once. This can save memory and improve performance.
3. If you want to print the values in a specific order, consider using a list comprehension instead of a for-loop. This allows you to specify the order you want to print the values in.
4. You could also add an additional check to make sure that the loop generates at least one value before exiting.
